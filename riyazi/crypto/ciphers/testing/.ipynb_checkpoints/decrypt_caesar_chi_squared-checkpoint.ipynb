    "    ====================\n",
    "\n",
    "    The caesar cipher\n",
    "    -----------------\n",
    "    The caesar cipher is a very insecure encryption algorithm, however it has\n",
    "    been used since Julius Caesar. The cipher is a simple substitution cipher\n",
    "    where each character in the plain text is replaced by a character in the\n",
    "    alphabet a certain number of characters after the original character. The\n",
    "    number of characters away is called the shift or key. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Plain text: hello\n",
    "    Key: 1\n",
    "    Cipher text: ifmmp\n",
    "    (each letter in hello has been shifted one to the right in the eng. alphabet)\n",
    "\n",
    "    As you can imagine, this doesn't provide lots of security. In fact\n",
    "    decrypting ciphertext by brute-force is extremely easy even by hand. However\n",
    "     one way to do that is the chi-squared test.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The chi-squared test\n",
    "    -------------------\n",
    "    Each letter in the english alphabet has a frequency, or the amount of times\n",
    "    it shows up compared to other letters (usually expressed as a decimal\n",
    "    representing the percentage likelihood). The most common letter in the\n",
    "    english language is \"e\" with a frequency of 0.11162 or 11.162%. The test is\n",
    "    completed in the following fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The ciphertext is decoded in a brute force way (every combination of the\n",
    "       26 possible combinations)\n",
    "    2. For every combination, for each letter in the combination, the average\n",
    "       amount of times the letter should appear the message is calculated by\n",
    "       multiplying the total number of characters by the frequency of the letter\n",
    "\n",
    "       For example:\n",
    "       In a message of 100 characters, e should appear around 11.162 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "     3. Then, to calculate the margin of error (the amount of times the letter\n",
    "        SHOULD appear with the amount of times the letter DOES appear), we use\n",
    "        the chi-squared test. The following formula is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Let:\n",
    "        - n be the number of times the letter actually appears\n",
    "        - p be the predicted value of the number of times the letter should\n",
    "          appear (see #2)\n",
    "        - let v be the chi-squared test result (referred to here as chi-squared\n",
    "          value/statistic)\n",
    "\n",
    "        (n - p)^2\n",
    "        --------- = v\n",
    "           p\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Each chi squared value for each letter is then added up to the total.\n",
    "       The total is the chi-squared statistic for that encryption key.\n",
    "    5. The encryption key with the lowest chi-squared value is the most likely\n",
    "       to be the decoded answer.\n",
