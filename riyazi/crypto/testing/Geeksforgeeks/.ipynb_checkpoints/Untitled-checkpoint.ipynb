    "**Description**\n",
    "Advanced Advance Cryptography Concepts, deep dive explanation into to the advantages, disadvantages, use case, constraints, limitations of symmetric, asymmetric, Hashing, algorithms, Public Key Infrastructure, Certificate Authority, Secure Channels, TLS, and standards. Course covers through explains of Applications of Cryptography, Private and public key pairs, and Binary math, the good bad and ugly for all symmetric and asymmetric algorithms with practical use cases for how algorithms are uses today and how their weakness are discovered and broke, such as with WEP and DES. Cryptographic Secure Channels and cybersecurity defense counter measures, Cryptanalysis attacks, Cryptography standards, to include VPS, IPSEC, AH, ESP, and major attacks against crypto systems.\n",
